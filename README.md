The order of execution of the codes.

1. table_to_image (included in TableToMat function)

2.image_cons (create rectangular coded images)

3.eight_to_twentyfour (8 bits to 24 bits)

4.image_aug (Augmentation)

Since the file upload limit is 25 MB, we only shared the images without augmentation.
When the above codes are run sequentially, images can be easily obtained with augmentation.

Finally, artificial intelligence-based models can be trained easily by utilizing architectures such as ResNet18 and ResNet50 used in the study.
